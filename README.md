# Fast Viewport Alignment

Fast Viewport Alignment is a lightweight and simple add-on that quickly snaps your viewport to the nearest orthographic axis view with a single shortcut.

## Feature Description
Instantly snap your 3D viewport to the nearest orthographic axis view with a single keypress. Instead of manually selecting the orthographic view you want, just press your preferred shortcut key to instantly snap to which ever axis you are most closely aligned to. The default assigned shortcut is `Alt + Spacebar`.

## Note
While the default assigned shortcut is `Alt + Spacebar`, if your workflow allows it, assigning only the `Spacebar` as your shortcut is the most ergonomic and complimentary way to use the add-on.
